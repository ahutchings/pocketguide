				<description><![CDATA[Artist: Randy Burnett<br>This will be a twist on my previous projects, instead of LEDs lighting the inside of infinite mirror. I will be using computer monitors with 3D animations reflecting infinitely. The plan is to split a video signal between 5 to 8 computer monitors arranged in polygonal form with one way mirrors capping it off creating the infinite effect making a video tunnel. I am hoping to use this as the ceiling of The Infinite Us. It will also work as a stand alone video portal.<br>Funded Art<br>http://www.euphoriaburn.com/content/art-blog]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Artist: Matthew "Zeus" Morris<br>Let there be... GLITTER JARS! What's a glitter jar, you ask? Why, it's a lava lamp, which requires no electricity, and is made of GLITTER!!! Watch a rainbow of glitter spin on the SPINDOZER GLITTERBOMB. This Ferris wheel-like contraption holds 8 "jars" (plastic!), each at an slight angle. At this angle, as the wheel turns, each jar is flipped over, sending glitter globules oozing and tumbling to the bottom. As the glitter does this, bright light shines through the jars and the glitter, creating a dazzling effect! Brilliant! (Literally!) The SPINDOZER GLITTERBOMB can also be spun quickly, fully agitating the GLITTER RAINBOW. Lie beneath the wheel on our water resistant camping blanket and gaze upon the colors of the glitter as they are altered by turbulent forces! SCIENCE! ART!

This year we have persuaded it to truly sing upon your contact. The crystal can assist you on your journey; with your cooperation it can open the folded, old creases of your mind and inject life in them as only foreign space crystals can. We will provide you with the crystal's aura, some casual dance music, some delicious plant food, and general peace or airhorn chaos depending on the crystal's desires. Trust no one except the crystal and the learnings you gain from it.
